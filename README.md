# Adaptive Grounding for Robots in Social and Task-Oriented Environments 🤖🗣️⚙️

**Adaptive Grounding** explores how robots can dynamically switch between *social interaction* and *task execution* based on multimodal cues from the user — creating more natural and collaborative human-robot experiences.

## 🌟 Concept

Traditional robotic systems are often trained for either:
- Performing **tasks** based on explicit commands, or
- Engaging in **social interaction** through conversation or gestures.

This project aims to combine both modes — enabling a robot to fluidly adjust its behavior depending on the user’s needs and context.

## 🧠 Innovation

- **Behavior Switching**: A robot that seamlessly transitions between:
    - *Social Mode*: Conversation, assistance, emotional interaction.
    - *Task Mode*: Executing physical actions based on language commands.
- **Cue-driven Adaptation**: The robot interprets multimodal cues (language, tone, gestures, proximity, idle time) to decide when to switch modes.

## 🎁 Potential Contributions

- Advancing the field of **adaptive human-robot interaction**.
- Building **multi-functional robots** that handle both social and task-driven contexts gracefully.
- Improving collaborative experiences in domains such as:
    - Service robots
    - Companion robots
    - Industrial cobots
    - Educational robots

## 📚 Dataset (In Progress)

- A custom dataset of **task-based** and **social interaction** sessions.
- Annotated with mode-switching triggers based on:
    - Language patterns
    - Gestures
    - Facial expressions
    - Proximity and engagement signals
